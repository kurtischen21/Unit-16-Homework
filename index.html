<h2>Hi, I'm Kurtis.</h2>
<p>Currently out here living my best life.
<br><br>
I love: music, my dog, designing, traveling, cooking, drinking/eating (maybe too much), and getting lost in a good game.
<br><br>
Here are some things I enjoy and some facts about me:
<ul>
<b>Music</b>: Hardstyle, trance, and everything else<br>
<b>Food</b>: Is everything a food?<br>
<b>Skills</b>: I can speak Cantonese (sorta).<br>
</ul>
 
<p>
I got into UX/UI design as an idea through a friend who was managing social media, e-commerce websites, and working as a designer for various companies.<br><br>
After some research, I started to realize that it was taking what I wanted to do originally, but also providing me with a much larger and effective skillset to be successful.
