<div id="aboutMe">
<p>hi, i'm kurtis.
<br><br>
currently out here living my best life.
<br><br>
i love: music, my dog, designing, traveling, cooking, drinking/eating (maybe too much), and getting lost in a good game.
<br><br>
here are some of my favorites:
<ul>
music: hardstyle, trance, and everything else<br>
food: carbs, carbs, carbs<br>
fav destinations so far: thailand, japan, hong kong<br><br>
</ul>

<p>
i got into UX/UI design as an idea through a friend who was managing social media, e-commerce websites, and working as a designer for various companies.<br><br>
after some research, i started to realize that it was taking what i wanted to do originally, but also providing me with a much larger and effective skillset to be successful.
